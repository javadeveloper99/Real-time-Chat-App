# DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT :-
      

The Real-Time Chat Application is a responsive messaging platform built using WebSockets for seamless communication and a front-end framework like Vue.js or React.js. It enables users to exchange messages in real-time with a modern, user-friendly interface. The backend, powered by Node.js and Socket.IO, ensures efficient message handling and broadcasting. Message history is stored in a database, allowing users to revisit past conversations. The application features responsive design for accessibility across devices and ensures smooth interaction with minimal latency. This project demonstrates core web development skills, including real-time data handling, front-end responsiveness, and server-client communication using WebSocket protocols.
